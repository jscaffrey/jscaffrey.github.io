Hi.  I'm Julia Caffrey.  I am a librarian and technology enthusiast currently living in the Boston area.

I currently work for [Simmons College Library](http://www2.simmons.edu/library/).  I graduate in May with my MLIS from
[Simmons SLIS](http://www.simmons.edu/academics/schools/school-of-library-and-information-science).
In the past I taught English in Japan with the [JET Program](http://jetprogramme.org/en/).
