I recently gave a short talk on my trip to [ASIS&T Annual Meeting 2015](https://www.asist.org/events/annual-meeting/annual-meeting-2015/) in St. Louis.  

My trip was sponsored by the amazing folks at [NE ASIS&T](http://neasist.org/) as their Travel Award student winner for the year. This year's conference theme was on impact in the community.
