[NE ASIS&T](https://neasist.asist.org/)'s Annual Conference UX & You focused on user experience design and research.  The conference fell right at the end of a successful semester studying the topic with Professor Rong Tang at Simmons College.  For that reason, my classmates and I presented our projects conducted over the course of the semester.  

I'd highly recommend visiting NE ASIS&T's [UX & You Conference Roundup](https://neasist.asist.org/2016/01/08/user-experience-design-research-conference-roundup/) to learn more about their projects and for slides from my presentation.
